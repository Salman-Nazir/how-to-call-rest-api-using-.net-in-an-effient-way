How to call Restful API using .Net httpclient in an efficient way

The project provide better way to call a web API using .Net client with an example of external API
This project is useful in a sense that I have written a console application in order to call a real external API.
Users can get started with the project by running the console applicaiton.
Users can get help with my project by reading the code as well as by reading the material on microsoft msdn/documents (Calling a Web API From a .NET Client (C#))
I maintain this project but community is also welcome to contribute in code wherver you guys feel the code can be refeactored and clean.
